## Reports MVP Specific Guidance

The following files contain specific guidance for the Reports MVP implementation:

### Primary Files
1. **[reports-patterns.md](./reports-patterns.md)** - Complete reports development patterns
2. **[mcp-integration.md](./mcp-integration.md)** - MCP usage for reports testing and development
3. **[performance-optimization.md](./performance-optimization.md)** - Performance patterns for charts and data

### Supporting Files
- **[ui-consistency.md](./ui-consistency.md)** - Chart and visualization standards
- **[development.md](./development.md)** - Testing patterns for reports
- **[security-monitoring.md](./security-monitoring.md)** - Reports security considerations

## Quick Reference

### For Database Development
- Use **Supabase MCP** for all database operations
- Follow **reports-patterns.md** for RPC function standards
- Reference **performance-optimization.md** for query optimization

### For UI Development
- Use **shadcn MCP** for component discovery
- Use **Playwright MCP** for testing and validation
- Follow **ui-consistency.md** for chart patterns

### For Testing
- Use **Playwright MCP** as primary testing tool
- Reference **development.md** for test organization
- Follow **reports-patterns.md** for test structure

### For Performance
- Reference **performance-optimization.md** for all optimization patterns
- Use dynamic imports for chart components
- Implement proper caching strategies

## File Inclusion Patterns

### Always Included (Default)
All files in this directory are included by default unless specified otherwise.

### Conditionally Included
None currently - all steering files apply to general development.

### Manually Included
None currently - use `#steering-file-name` in chat to reference specific files.

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated when:
- New development patterns are established
- Technology stack changes occur
- Performance optimizations are discovered
- Security requirements evolve
- Testing strategies are refined

Last updated: Current as of Reports MVP implementation.
