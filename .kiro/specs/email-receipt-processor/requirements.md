# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ChiPhi AI is an email-first, multilingual receipt processing system that automatically translates, extracts, and categorizes financial data from receipt emails. The system provides explainable AI insights with real-time dashboards and learns from user corrections to improve future categorization accuracy. The MVP focuses on email ingestion, AI-powered extraction, and basic analytics while maintaining strict security and multi-tenant isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to forward receipt emails to a private alias so that the system can automatically process my receipts without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL generate a unique private email alias for that user
2. WHEN a receipt email is forwarded to the private alias THEN the system SHALL receive and process it within 60 seconds
3. WHEN an email is received THEN the system SHALL verify HMAC signature for security

5. IF an email lacks proper authentication THEN the system SHALL reject it and log the attempt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to translate receipts in any language to English so that I can understand and categorize expenses regardless of the original language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a receipt contains non-English text THEN the system SHALL detect the source language
2. WHEN non-English content is detected THEN the system SHALL translate it to English before extraction
3. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve both original and translated versions
4. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL provide an "Originalâ†”English" toggle
5. IF translation fails THEN the system SHALL proceed with original text and flag the issue

### Requirement 3

4. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL assign a confidence score (0-100)
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an explanation for the categorization decision

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections so that similar receipts are automatically categorized correctly in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user corrects a transaction category THEN the system SHALL update the MerchantMap for that merchant
2. WHEN processing future receipts from the same merchant THEN the system SHALL apply the learned categorization
3. WHEN multiple corrections exist for a merchant THEN the system SHALL use the most recent correction
4. WHEN a correction is made THEN the system SHALL apply it only within the user's tenant scope
5. IF no merchant mapping exists THEN the system SHALL use AI-based categorization with explanation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see explainable AI decisions on every transaction so that I can understand and trust the system's categorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a transaction THEN the system SHALL show a confidence badge
2. WHEN displaying a transaction THEN the system SHALL provide a "Why" explanation for the categorization
3. WHEN a user clicks the explanation THEN the system SHALL show detailed reasoning
4. WHEN displaying receipts THEN the system SHALL provide original text toggle functionality
5. WHEN confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL highlight the transaction for review
